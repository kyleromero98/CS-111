lab3a.c:
Contains all the source code for the lab. The code makes extensive use of a provided
header file, ext2_fs.h, which contains various structs and types to handle the
ext2 file system. Each part of the spec is handled by a distinct function ranging
from handling the superblock to handling the indirect blocks.

Makefile:
This contains the make targets that were specified in the spec. The default
make target just goes ahead and builds the project using the -o and -g flags.
The 'dist' make target creates the tar ball with all the required files (source, 
header file, the makefile, the README). The 'clean' make target deletes the
executable for a clean build.

README:
Contains descrptive information about the project files.
