Project 0 - README

INCLUDED FILES
lab0.c - a C source file that contains the code that follows the specification for project 0
Makefile - allows for making, cleaning, making for distribution, and running some smoke tests
backtrace.png - a screenshot that shows a segfault and associated backtrace using GDB to debug the program
breakpoint.png - a screenshot that shows a breakpoint with variable inspection
README - this file that provides usefule information regarding my submission for this project

SMOKE-TEST CASES
#1 - Checks for the functionality of --input and --output by comparing input to output file
#2 - Checks for segfault and successful catch by --catch by comparing the output of the program to a test file
#3 - Checks for invalid input file (hllo.txt) and makes sure that we get an error regarding this by comparing to test file
#4 - Checks for an invalid option passed to the program; compares to a test file to ensure we get proper error message
#5 - Checks for an output file that we do not have proper permissions (write syscall fails); compares to a test file to ensure that we get proper error message

OTHER INFORMATION
For any detected error that was not explicitly addressed in the specification I opted to return exit code 5 instead of reusing one
of the exit codes that was explicitly assigned to in the specification.
